Task 1:
The vehicle can safely travel 360 km without refueling.
Assuming dropping fuel and topping up counts as refuelling, we have 60L of fuel which translates to 720km
In order to safely return, we can only go half as far, so 360km

Task 2:
We solved this task by simply dumping fuel in 360km increments until we had enough fuel to get to the end

Task 3:

We solved this task by dumping an absolutely obscene amount of fuel in the desert with no attention to optimality.

Task 4:
Using N.J.Fine’s method to maximize the distance the vehicle can travel with given quantity of fuel,
We take 140 litres (max amount of fuel the vehicle can hold) as our base unit for fuel, we minimize the distance of the first trip by maximizing the second. 
The farthest fuel dump contains 1/3 of a unit of fuel (46.667 litres), with only 173 km left, the fuel dump next to the base only need to have 14.417 litres of fuel. 
Which is why this method is well optimized

Task 5:
We started by working backwards, figuring out the optimal trip assuming 360 length gaps between the main fuel deposits.
We then calculated the absolute minimum fuel needed in the desert for the last two trips.
This amounted to (120, 120, 120, 60) at locations (360, 720, 1080, 1440).
Once we had this, all that was left was to figure out the fastest way to get that amount of fuel into the desert.
