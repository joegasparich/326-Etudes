Alan had 24 points, meaning he came first in 4 subjects and second in 1. Since Ellen came first in Maths, Alan must have come second in Maths
If Charles had four 4s then there wouldn't be enough points for Barbara to come second
Similarly, if Charles got four 2s then he wouldn't have enough points to come third since Ellen got 8 with only 2 subjects, therefore must have gotten four 3s (not in Science due to Ellen)
Charles got 13, 14 or 16 aggregate
With no 3s remaining, Barbara has to have at least three 4s in order to beat Charles (can't be in Maths)
The remaining 4 can't be given to Charles or Barbara wouldn't be able to beat him, and can't be given to Ellen or she wouldn't be last, therefore must be David
Barbara could have gotten a 4 in English, History, French or Science but I'm going to assume its English, History and French since it doesn't affect the answer
Ellen has a minimum of 11 points, which David needs 8 points to beat, meaning he has to have four 2s in his remaining subjects
Ellen therefore had to have less than 12 points, giving her three 1s in his remaining subjects
Charles needs to beat 12 with a 1 or a 2, giving him 13 or 14. If he got a 14, then Barbara would also get a 14 with the remaining 1s
Therefore, Charles gets 1 in Science and Barbara gets 1 in Maths, 2 in Science, filling out the table

1. 	Barbara got a mark of 1 in mathematics
	Alan, Charles and David got the same mark in four papers

SOCCER

Win = 2
Draw = 1
Loss = 0

E has played against all 4 other teams
B has only played against E
C has played maximum of 3 games since it can't have faced B, meaning it must have won 3 in order to get its 6 points
C has played against A, D and E
A has played a maximum of 3 games, and it lost one to C, meaning it had to win its other 2 in order to get 4 points
A has played against C, D and E
E's losses therefore must have been to A and C meaning B's 1 game was a draw
D's game to E was a draw, D's game to C was a loss and it's game to A was a loss

Game Breakdown

X scored against Y

	A	B	C	D	E	GF
A	X	X	0	1	1	2
B	X	X	X	X	0	0
C	1	X	X	3	1	5
D	0	X	0	X	0	0
E	0	0	0	0	X	0
GA	1	0	0	4	2

In order to lose, E must have taken at least 1 goal in each loss, meaning each of it's draws were 0:0
Therefore B's one game was 0:0 and D's game to E was 0:0, A and C's game to E was 1:0
A must have been scored against to lose its loss, therefore it lost 0:1 to C
C scored 5 goals, and it got 2 of them in 2 of its games, therefore it must have scored 3 against D
D took 4 goals, 3 of them were to C and 0 of them were to E, therefore it took 1 goal from A
C was not scored against, therefore it took 0 goals in all its games
A took 1 goal which was from C, therefore it took none against D
D therefore scored no goals against anyone
A therefore scored 1 against D and E, giving it 2 goals scored, filling out the table

2.	C has played team D, the score was 3:0 to team C
